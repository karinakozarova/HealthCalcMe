        <p class="h2"> Welcome to HealthCalc! Be prepared to become the best version of yourself. We are here to guide you along the way. Get ready to invest in your body. Sometimes, your brain can be your own worst enemy. Keep yourself mentally sharp (and thinking positive thoughts) by snacking on nuts, adopting a Mediterranean cooking style, and getting plenty of sleep. Be prepared by staying hydrated and choosing the right pre- and post-workout liquids to fuel your body and help your muscles recover, such as water, sports drinks, or chocolate milk. </p>
